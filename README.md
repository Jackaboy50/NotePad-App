# NotePad-App
This is a Notepad app created in C# winforms. It uses a procedurally generated user interface alongside a txt file to create and store notes.

Notes can be: 
- Created
- Saved
- Opened
- Deleted

All saved notes are stored within the txt and are loaded upon application launch.

Above is an example of the application in use, we have a saved note and we are creating a new note.
